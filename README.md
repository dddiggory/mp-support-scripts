# mp-support-scripts

A repo for sharing & iterating on customer-facing Mixpanel Support scripts & code snippets. Scripts on this repo do something interesting and/or are too specific for the main mixpanel-solutions repo.

These scripts have NOT been formally reviewed - do not use them on customer data unless you're 100% sure of what they do. And if you're curious about what a script is all about, please feel free to come and ask! These aren't perfect, but should each contain something educational for aspiring scripters.
